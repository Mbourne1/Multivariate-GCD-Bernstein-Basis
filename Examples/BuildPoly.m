function [fxy_bi] = BuildPoly(root_mult_matrix)
% Given a set of roots for f(x,y), build the polynomial so that the output
% is a vector of coefficients for the polynomial in the modified Bernstein 
% basis.

% Inputs
%
% root_mult_array
%
% root : factor 
%
% Outputs.
%
% fxy_bi : (Matrix) Coefficients of polynomial f(x,y) in scaled Bernstein 
% form

% Calculate the number of distinct roots of the polynomial.

% Convolve each factor, which is defined by a row of A, separately.
% A(k,1) stores the value of the root, and A(k,2) stores its multiplicity.
